    <h1>Healthy Baked Chicken Tenders</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>With just a few simple ingredients and a super quick baking time (about 20 minutes), these Baked Chicken Tenders are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They’re a total hit with kids and adults and you only need 4 simple ingredients to make them.</p>
    <p>Since these chicken tenders are baked, there’s no need for oil or excess fat. I use a little nonstick spray to coat the baking rack, but otherwise, it’s a healthy chicken recipe. I do give you the option to use crushed tortilla chips or panko breadcrumbs and of the two, we LOVE the tortilla chips. So do try that route if you have them on hand.</p>
    <p>They’re perfectly seasoned and just the right level of salt—without the need for any additional seasoning in the breading.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.4 kg white or yellow corn tortilla chips (or 1 cup panko breadcrumbs and ¼ salt</li>
        <li>450g chicken tenders</li>
        <li>42g all-purpose four</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C and place a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Coat the rack well with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Add the tortilla chips to a food processor or blender and process into fine crumbs. You should have about 1 cup. Pour into a shallow dish or pie plate.</li>
        <li>Add the flour to a second shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Break the eggs into another shallow dish and beat lightly.</li>
        <li>Working with one tender at a time, dredge the chicken completely in the flour, egg, and then tortilla crumbs and place on the prepared rack. Continue to finish the rest of the chicken. (Optional: Sprinkle chicken with salt.)</li>
        <li>Bake for 14-15 minutes or until completely cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or at room temperature with ketchup, ranch, marinara sauce, or applesauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Store any leftover chicken in the fridge in an airtight container. Serve cold or warm briefly in a 180-degree-C oven or in the microwave for 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Do bake them on a wire rack as instructed. This allows air to circulate underneath so the tops and bottoms are perfectly crispy.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken well in the flour, egg, and crumbs to ensure the best results.</li>
        <li>If using the tortilla chip option, be sure to totally crush them to create an even crumb.</li>
        <li>If using panko, add ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Serve as strips or cut into pieces according to what will work best for your child.</li>
        <li>Reheat in the oven to return the chicken to crispy, or pack in a lunch and enjoy chilled.</li>
        <li>Air fryer: Coat the rack with nonstick spray. Prepare the chicken as directed in the recipe, then air-fry at 200 degrees C for 8 minutes, turning halfway through.</li>
    </ul>
