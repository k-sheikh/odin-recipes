    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Cheesy Rice recipe has four options to add in veggies. It's SO easy, versatile, and stores wonderfully in the fridge. And it's downright delish!</p>
    <p>I love this approach to Cheesy Rice because of the four flavor variations is easy for kids (and adults!) to eat, the veggies are soft, and there's just enough cheese to help it be creamyâ€”without going overboard in the richness department. It has a full cup less cheese than many other cheesy rice recipes (to cut down on the sodium a little), but is still so delicious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g short grain brown rice (or sprouted rice or other white rice)</li>
        <li>182 g finely chopped broccoli florets (OR 2 cups cauliflower "rice" OR 2 cups shredded carrots, OR 2 cups thawed frozen corn)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    </ol>
    <h4>Cheesy Rice with Broccoli</h4>

    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Store leftovers in the fridge for 3-5 days in an airtight container or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge and serve warm.</li>
        <li>To make a version of this idea without dairy, you can replace the butter with olive oil or coconut oil and use mashed avocado instead of the cheese to help the rice hold together.</li>
        <li>When making the cauliflower one, I like to use white rice so the rice and the cauliflower blend together well.</li>
        <li>You could also stir in chopped spinach to the cooked rice with the cheese to make a leafy greens version.</li>
        <li>Use whichever rice you prefer, adjusting the cooking time according to the directions on the package.</li>
        <li>Let the kids eat with a spoon or their hands.</li>
        <li>Serve as a vegetarian main dish or with your favorite protein main.</li>
    </ul>
